An example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we had a dataset with numbers representing the cloudiness of the sky\nand the amount of rainfall each day for every day in the past year, we could try to\nfit an equation to that data and then interpolate the amount of rainfall that\ncould be expected for today given the number(s) representing how cloudy today is.<br>\n[TODO: linear regression diagram]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So far so good, predicting stuff sounds innocuous enough -</p>\n<p><em>So what causes AI to become abominable?</em>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Technology is the application of scientific knowledge to the practical aims of human life</a></em></p>\n<p>When we run an AI model to predict the weather or figure out whether a picture\nis that of a cat or a dog, that's work that no one really cares about.\nIt’s grunt work - the less of it we have to do to get the outcome we want the\nhappier we’d be.</p>\n<p>Contrast this with the activities that we partake in that we value intrinsically -\ntaking a walk in the park, hanging out with friends, <em>creating art</em> - If an AI could\nautomagically make a poem to express whatever it is you wanted to express, would you\nreally prefer that outcome to your own expression?</p>\n<p>And this is where we get Abominable Intelligence.<br>\nInstead of a world where AI menial soul-crushing tasks like figuring out\nwhether some shitty low-res image is a bicycle or a cat while people create art,\nwe have a world where people pay generative AI to plagiarize other people's art\nwhile waves of human wage slaves slog away classifying text and images for\n<a href=\"https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">$2 an hour in digital sweatshops</a>.</p>\n<h2>AI Art is Theft</h2>\n<p>The output of every AI model is some combination of multiplication (weights),\naddition (biases, linear combinations of inputs), line bending (RELU activation etc.),\nand aggregation (e.g. taking the maximum value of a group if pixels in a max-pooling layer).</p>\n<p>With generative AI models, we have a system that does math to make a\nstatistical aggregation of the input text / images / audio, and spits out random\nsamples of this statistical aggregation soup to create your generative AI image\nor whatever. We know it's all just math, so any creativity has to come from the input.\nOr more precisely, generative AI is literally just remixing the input data in a way\nthat looks good.</p>\n<p>We know none of these fucking AI companies give two shits about sourcing their data\nfrom sources that are okay with being trained on and / or compensate the sources\nfairly, it has become a plagiarism machine for generative AI companies.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Abominable Intelligence","description":"Generative AI is antithetical to life itself","date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/abominable-intelligence/","tags":["Politics"]}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2031412112","2709483142","3539500889","3825832676"],"slicesMap":{}}
