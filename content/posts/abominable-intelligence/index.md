So my goal here is to create a compiler from a source programming language
to a 1D cellular automata. The primary reason for this is that I think it's possible
to develop tools to analyze the halt-ability of some classes of programs
when expressed in this form, but also:

1. to be entirely honestly I've always
   thought that writing a compiler sounds cool and wanted an excuse to
   get into an endeavor as massive as this one
2. I did take a compilers course back in uni, but it always felt incomplete
   in the sense that although we had lessons on the different stages of a
   compiler as well as a few labs on lexing and parsing,
   we never actually got around to make a full-fledged compiler.

```css
.grid__item {
  &:hover,
  &:focus-within {
    background-color: #eee;
  }

  a {
    position: relative;
    z-index: 1;
  }

  h2 {
    a {
      position: static;

      &:hover,
      &:focus {
        color: blue;
      }

      &:before {
        content: '';
        display: block;
        position: absolute;
        z-index: 0;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        top: 0;
        left: 0;
        transition: background-color 0.1s ease-out;
        background-color: transparent;
      }
    }
  }
}
```
