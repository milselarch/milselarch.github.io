_What is AI?_  
AI is the fitting of a mathematical equation to a bunch of numerical data points,
so that you can create an statistical representation of said data points.

_What is the purpose of all this?_  
Well the idea is that If we get a new data point we can plug it into the equation
and use the interpolated value as a prediction. An example:

- If we had a dataset with numbers representing the cloudiness of the sky
  and the amount of rainfall each day for every day in the past year, we could try to
  fit an equation to that data and then interpolate the amount of rainfall that
  could be expected for today given the number(s) representing how cloudy today is.

So far so good, predicting stuff sounds innocuous enough -

_So what causes AI to become abominable?_

When we run an AI model to predict the weather or figure out whether a picture
is that of a cat or a dog, that's work that no one really cares about.
It’s grunt work - the less of it we have to do to get the outcome we want the
happier we’d be.
