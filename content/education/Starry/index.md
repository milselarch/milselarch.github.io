- Developed an in-browser B2B helpdesk chatbot that matches user questions
  to answers previously provided by help desk workers to reduce tech support
  manpower needs using the RASA-NLU natural language processing library,
  and a MySQL, Flask, and jQuery web stack.
- Performed automated website UI testing for GhostInspector for client projects.
- Forwarded questions that the chatbot could not resolve on its own to the
  companyâ€™s in-house ticket management system via their REST API.
