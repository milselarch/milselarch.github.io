Slimedown shooter is a top-down 2D shooter game where the objective is
to survive the endless waves of slimes that spawn in and collect the slime
they leave behind to replenish your health. The game was made using a
[scriptable object architecture](https://unity.com/how-to/architect-game-code-scriptable-objects),
and in-game lighting is made using
[URP shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@7.1/manual/shaders-in-universalrp.html),
while the in-game UI is created using UI Toolkit and
[USS](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIE-USS.html).
