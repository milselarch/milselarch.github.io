Built a responsive hotel booking web app for Ascenda using a MySQL, Vue.js, and
Django (python backend) web stack. Webapp is currently deployed using Firebase static
web hosting and a [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/)
cloud instance for hosting the backend and database.
Also created frontend tests using the Vue Test Utils library, including
fuzzing and unit tests.
