- Developed a single-page application (SPA) mobile web-app using a MySQL, VueJS,
  and Flask (python backend) web stack that allowed users to interact with,
  create routes for, and view analysis results from a building inspection robot.
- Ported the existing frontend codebase tech stack originally written in
  JavaScript only, to instead use the Vue.js framework and the Bulma CSS framework,
  and improved code scalability by splitting the codebase into reusable components
  using a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture.
- Deployed the frontend and backend codebases and configured the Apache server
  and MySQL database on test servers, and documented the deployment process.
