Autolooper is a simple CLI tool that allows users to extend audio in
.wav music files by identifying and looping audio sections that are similar
enough to be repeated seamlessly.

The .wav file parser, output .wav file writer,
and audio similarity detection algorithms were all implemented from scratch in C.
