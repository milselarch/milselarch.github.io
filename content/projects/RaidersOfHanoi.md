Raiders of hanoi is a 2D arcade game where the player has to move around using the
joystick, to pick up disks and drop them onto the towers to solve
the 4-disk towers of hanoi while avoiding the enemies that would spawn from
the right edge and move left to attack the player.

Implemented in [lucid](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/programming-an-fpga/lucid)
as a state machine running on the [Alcitry AU](https://alchitry.com/boards/au/)
FPGA that selects inputs to a single 16-bit ALU as part of the 50.002 1D
project requirements.
