ScanCart is an app that utilises the “tap-and-go” capability of
Near Field Communication (NFC) in smartphones to allow elderly to obtain their
groceries conveniently and monitor their nutritional intake based on their
health profiles.

Created as part of the 1D project for the 50.004
(information systems) module.
