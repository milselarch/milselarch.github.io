Ranked Choice Voting algorithm implementations
using Tries. Ranked choice algorithm variations implemented
thus far are Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), IRV with
[dowdall scoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count) as a tie-breaker,
ranked pairs, and a [condorcet compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_winner_criterion)
variant of Ranked Pairs.
